Further Explanations
====================

Â 

When it comes to more difficult passages, one will need to be mindful about not
only what would be logical, but also what would represent the music the closest.
For instance, If I were to look at the source, and I could not tell where voices
started, stopped, if there was a clear reason for coding it that way, then that
would probably not be the best solution.

I would want to look at the music (which is mostly logical) and make it more
closely represented in the file. A further example will be noted below.
