Financial contributions
-----------------------

If you would like to make a financial contribution, any amount is appreciated.
This is a side project, but it is expending significant resources. I’m doing it
first for my love of this piece, so feel no pressure to donate; again, any
amount is appreciated.

If you’d like an idea of a suggested donation, please send me an email, and I’d
be glad to assist you in figuring that out. If you have any questions, email me
