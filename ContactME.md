How to get in touch with me
===========================

I am most quickly available by email. You can reach me at
<joshdnichols.music@gmail.com>. This is the quickest way.

To avoid spam
=============

Please include in your subject “Rach-Rach-Rach” or I will delete it.

Otherwise...
============

If you have a particular job you’d be interested in (such as fingering, slur
shaping, dynamic-text markup, note entry, editing, *etcetera*), please feel free
to let me know, and that way I can set you up with some starting places (unless
you have ideas of your own!).

Do check back frequently to see what I’ve done, and always update your local
fork of this repository before beginning any work.

I’m very open to ideas
======================

If you do have any ideas or methods you’d like to employ, or like to see
employed globally across the score, feel free to share them! In the end, I’d
like this to go to publication.
